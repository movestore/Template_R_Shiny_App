- introduces a _Template Synchronization_ GH action. Use it to synchronize your forked app with template updates. If you already forked from the template _before_ SDK `v3.0.0` you can (*only use this option if your app is written for input data of class `move2`*): 
    1. manually add the files `.github/workflows/template-sync.yml` and `.github/.templatesyncignore` to your fork. 
    1. with these files you can manually execute the GH action named _.github/workflows/template-sync.yml_. 
    1. after merging the generated pull request add the file `app-configuration.json` manually to the root directory of your App.

- fix app-configuration for execution on moveapps.org
- clear app output of previously app run at each start of the SDK

- SDK supports [`move2`](https://gitlab.com/bartk/move2/), if input is of class [`move`](https://gitlab.com/bartk/move/) it will be converted into class `move2`.
- output is always move2
- Upgrade `R` framework to `4.3.1`
